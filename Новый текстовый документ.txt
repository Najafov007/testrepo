One of the most popular theories of ending since 2014 - Actually THE REAL Faith was in the beggining and at the end. "Faith" that we've been talking about whole game, that she's dead, the body and the head - is Nerissa, Nerissa that glaumored herself to look like Faith. That is why when we were asking the mirror to show us Faith - he said that some magic is not letting him to do this, these lips are sealed. Also That is why SwineHeart said he wants to run more tests, he understood that something was wrong with the body and tried to find out what. When Bigby says I feel like we've met before - "Nerissa" (Actually Faith) immidiately says another thing to aviod something suspicious, and says They call me The Little Marmaid) So with one word, almost whole game Faith was Nerissa, and Nerissa was Faith. Faith were helping us to find out the killer of Nerrisa and Lily. Amazing, isn't it?) TellTale were always suprising us
